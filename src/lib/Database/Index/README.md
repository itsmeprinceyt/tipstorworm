This is my whole database:

- Paste file content of `../Migrations/<Initial_DB>`

- what to do
1. I want you to create an array of strings in which there will be query written for creating INDEX without the ';' at the end of it separate by commas
2. I also want you to same create an array of string in which there will be query written for dropping of those same index
3. do not remake the index of those things who have foregin constraint as they are automatically created and wont be created or dropped no matter what. so we are going to make only those who wont be automatic.
4. following is the reference of existing index

- Paste file content of `./Indexing.ts`
